This is the [Forms Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/forms) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

This project creates an app that manages a table of users.  It involves building forms with just HTML, then rebuilding them with Rails form helpers.
